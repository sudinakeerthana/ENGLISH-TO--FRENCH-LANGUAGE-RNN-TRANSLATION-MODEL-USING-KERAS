# ENGLISH-TO--FRENCH-LANGUAGE-RNN-TRANSLATION-MODEL-USING-KERAS
A computer-based machine that is used to translate text or speech without the involvement of human. In the research field of NLP, it is a popular subject that is being developed using different approaches such as ”rule-based”, ”statistical” and ”example- based”. In machine translation, Neural networks build a huge lead. In this paper, we aim to constructs a function in a RNN that would take part in the “end-to-end translation pipeline”. The constructed pipeline returns ”French Translation” on considering input “English text”. This paper consists of three major steps: preprocessing of dataset, model building, and running prediction models to translate english to french.
